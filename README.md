# Tic_Tac_Toe_game
I implement Tic Tac Toe game using my C knowledge with data structures and algorithms.  

This is a simple implementation of a Tic Tac Toe game in C. The code uses a 1D array to represent the Tic Tac Toe grid, with 0 for empty cells, 1 for 'X' pieces, and -1 for 'O' pieces. Players take turns placing their pieces and moving them to adjacent empty cells. The game continues until one player wins or the grid is filled, resulting in a draw.
The game starts by requesting player names, and then it randomly selects who goes first (either 'X' or 'O'). The first phase of the game is the placement phase, where players take turns placing their pieces on the grid. The second phase is the movement phase, where players take turns moving their pieces to adjacent empty cells.

The code also includes functions to check for valid placements and movements, collision checks, win conditions, and displays the grid after each turn.
